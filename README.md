# Simulated Elevator

Your goal is to implement the logical code for an elevator. This simulated elevator is a single elevator for a 5 story building.

To start running the elevator, just compile and run Main. System.out will print what the elevator is doing.

The only existing file in `src/` you may modify is `Main.java` and only between lines 14 and 39. `ISimulatedElevator.java`, `SimulatedElevator.java` and `ButtonHandler.java` must remain untouched.

Feel free to create any additional classes, interfaces, etc that you think make sense for your implementation.

There are comments in ButtonHandler and ISimulatedElevator explaining what each method does.
